Assignment - Mini IPL Scheduler

Problem Statement -

We have to create a match scheduler application for a cricket tournament (IPL).

Summary -

The tournament consisting of n teams is to be organized and we have to schedule the matches for these teams and the matches to be played over x days. Each team will have its home city or home ground defined where the team will play half of its matches i.e., n-1 matches.

Given are following assumptions you have to take -

1. Each team will play the other n-1 teams twice over x days period. 

2. No more than 2 matches to be played on a single day (1 in day and 1 in night). If the input number of days is too small to arrange all matches, an error must be thrown. 

3. Each team can play a maximum of 1 match per day.

Expectations -

Find total number of matches that will be played among teams.

Back End -

1. REST APIs to Add/Remove/View Teams 

2. Schedule Creator

3. Use any  in-memory (H2) DB Storage. 

3. Search Schedule APIs ( team name or date )

4. All code should be covered with test case
